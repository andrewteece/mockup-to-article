You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* Researching solutions when unsure what the next step may be. Also being able to observe different solutions to the same problem.
* The flow of reading a mockup and applying the proper tree structure in HTML
* syntax error due to typing to fast...need to slow down...learn to walk before I run :)
* This goes back to the first question. Making it a habit to look various elements on MDN when I have question in my mind how it will be used. Going to Google and StackOverflow and reading through the various solutions to whatever problem or questions I may have.

Really enjoy this journey!
